/**
 * ===========================================
 *           FREQUENCY COUNTER
 * ===========================================
 *
 * - Frequency counter is a problem-solving technique useful when you need
 * to compare 2 sets of data such as arrays or strings to determine if they
 * have the same frequency of elements or characters.
 *
 * -The idea behind a frequency counter is to usually use an object to break
 * down the contents of an array or a string so that you can quickly compare
 * that breakdown with another object that was constructed from a string or an array.
 *
 * -WHEN WE USE IT, we create an object to store the ellements in our string or array,
 * along with how many times they occur in that string or array. More specifically,
 * the element is usually a key in that object and the value for that key is how many
 * times that element is found
